# Po.et Browser
A simple Po.et browser for displaying works via the Frost API.

## Installation

Download the Po.et Browser package zip or check out the code from Github (https://github.com/knowledgearcdotorg/poet-browser).

Extract the downloaded zip file to your computer. You can unzip the package to a web server such as Apache2 if you would prefer to run it via localhost (or a web address).

Browse to the index.html page using your web browser by either opening the index.html page directly or by browsing to the hosted Po.et Browser files. For example, If you have unzipped the Po.et Browser files to /var/www/html/poet-browser then you would browse to http://localhost/poet-browser/index.html.

## Usage

To view your works, enter your Frost token. Frost tokens can be created and managed by registering at https://frost.po.et.
